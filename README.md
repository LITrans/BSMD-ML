# Distributed Privacy-Aware Choice Modelling using Federated Learning

Using the distributed principles of the blockchain, we propose a federated learning model for choice modelling which is able to process distributed data from different sources without: 
1. Sharing personal raw information 
2. Requiring to send the information to central cloud servers. 

Users are always in control of their information as no raw personal information is shared and all transaction of information are recorded on the blockchain, so the users can track where their information is used

## Getting Started

To install the Iroha blockchain go to [network](network/)

To create the Federating Learining application go to [iroha](iroha/)

### Prerequisites
